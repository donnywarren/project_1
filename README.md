# Project #1: Your first application

### STEP 1: Read the Directions
1) Read **ALL** of the directions before doing step 2. We'll know...

### STEP 2: Make a New Repo
:heavy_exclamation_mark: You will be using your **personal GitHub**, **not** GitHub Enterprise!
1. [Make a new github repo for your project](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/). DO NOT CLONE THIS REPO.
2. Make sure it's set to "Public" and **DO NOT** initialize with a README.md file.
3. This will take you to a new page that you will use in Step 3.

### STEP 3: Pitch Your Project
Before you start coding, you will be meeting with an instructor for ~10 minutes to get your app idea approved. Prepare the following materials **before** this meeting and **update your README.md:** [MacDown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com/) is a great markdown editor. We strongly suggest you take advantage of its great UI.

Your README.md must contain the following sections:
- A working title for your app
- **Description** .4-5 sentences summarizing the functionality of your app. Feel free to include what problem is your app solving.
- **Wireframes** Wireframes showing your app's layout on desktop, tablet, and **mobile**. These can be as lo-fi or as hi-fi as you want. You can either to put these in the README or upload them to your repository.
- **API** What API you want to use and what information you want to get from it.
- **Features** Write out what features you will need to build in order to meet MVP.
- **Stretch goals** Stretch goals for additional / advanced features for when you complete your MVP.


### STEP 4: &#x1F534; Build Your Project MVP â€”  Mandatory To Pass

#### Your application must meet these requirements:

  1. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
  2. Hosted on **[Surge](https://surge.sh/)**
  3. Commits to github every day<br>
  4. A `README.md` file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, a link to your live site, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
  1. Use AJAX to make a request to an external data source like OMDBapi and insert some of the data retrieved into the DOM
  1. Implement responsive design (i.e. it should be fully functional on desktop, tablet, mobile, etc). Use at least 3 media  queries

#### ðŸ“‹ List of APIs

Below is a non-exhaustive list of some free APIs you can use. There are _many_ APIs out there, however, so if you find one not on this list that you'd like to use, feel free! Please note that some may require signing up for an API key.

  1. Star Wars: https://swapi.co/
  1. Weather: https://openweathermap.org/api
  1. News: https://newsapi.org/
  1. Giphy: https://developers.giphy.com/
  1. Pokemon: http://pokeapi.co/
  1. Card Deck: https://deckofcardsapi.com/
  1. Google Books: https://developers.google.com/books/
  1. City of Chicago: https://data.cityofchicago.org/
  1. Beer: https://www.brewerydb.com/developers
  1. Chuck Norris: http://www.icndb.com/
  1. Rick and Morty: https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#rest
  
Lastly, the following sites congregates a bunch of APIs together, so you can take a look through their libraries and try to find an API that interests you! Note, however, that not all APIs are free and many listed may require payment. We **highly suggest** to use a free API for your first project. 

  1. https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis
  1. https://rapidapi.com/

### STEP 5 - &#x1F535; Reach Stretch Goals (Not Mandatory)
- Look into [localstorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) so you can save data to the user's browser 
   - Check this very helpful tutorial on [Local Storage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8yJCeuP6I8)
- Add a second API
- Add creative use of event listeners and UI interaction(CSS animations and transitions)
- Get input from a UX student on how to make your app have intuitive UI and design


### STEP 6 - Technical Demonstration (10/04/2019)

All projects will be presented to the class.  Your presentation should:

* Be no longer than 5 minutes in length
* Show off all features of the app
* Explain the technical details
* Explain the technical challenges
* Explain which improvements you might make

You will be sharing your project and your code.  Be prepared to answer questions from the instructors and other students.

Did you read all of the directions before moving to step 2? If so, on part 2 of step 3, write `git commit -m "imma happy dino"` instead of `git commit -m "first commit"`. Your awesomeness will be rewarded...
